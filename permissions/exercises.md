# Practice Exercises â€“ File Permissions

1. Create a file named `mysecret.txt` that only its owner can access.
   - The owner should be able to read and write.
   - Others should have no permissions.

2. Change the permissions of `project.txt` so that:
   - The group can edit the file.
   - Others can neither read nor write.

3. Add the user `devuser` to the group `devteam` and verify that `devuser` can access files with group permissions.
