# Practice Exercises â€“ System Monitoring

1. Run the `top` command and sort processes by memory usage.
   - Take a screenshot showing the top 5 processes by memory consumption.

2. Find a dummy process (for example, a `sleep` command) using `ps aux` and kill it using the `kill` command.
   - Verify that the process is terminated by searching for it again.

3. Check disk space usage with `df -h` and inode usage with `df -i`.
   - Take screenshots of both outputs.

4. Check memory usage with `free -h`.
   - Note the total, used, and available memory.

5. Run `uptime` to see how long the system has been running and its load averages.
   - Note the output in a screenshot or log.
