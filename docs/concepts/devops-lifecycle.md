# 🔑 What is DevOps? (Simple)

DevOps is a **culture + practice** that unites **developers (who build apps)** and **operations (who run apps)** to deliver software **faster, more reliably, and continuously**.

# 🔄 DevOps Lifecycle — 5 Stages

1. **Plan** → Teams define features & goals.
    
    *Ex: An e-commerce site plans to add a “one-click checkout” feature.*
    
2. **Build & Code** → Developers write code, package apps (often into Docker images).
    
    *Ex: Checkout feature coded in Java, containerized for consistency.*
    
3. **Test & Integrate** → Automated testing & CI/CD pipelines ensure quality.
    
    *Ex: Jenkins pipeline runs unit tests whenever code is pushed to GitHub.*
    
4. **Deploy & Operate** → Apps are deployed to cloud/Kubernetes; infra scales.
    
    *Ex: Checkout feature deployed on AWS EC2 + Kubernetes to handle Black Friday traffic.*
    
5. **Monitor & Feedback** → Real-time monitoring, logging, and feedback loops.
    
    *Ex: Prometheus + Grafana alert if checkout latency > 2s, leading to fixes.*

👉 In short: **Plan → Code → Build → Test → Release → Deploy → Operate → Monitor** → repeat continuously.
